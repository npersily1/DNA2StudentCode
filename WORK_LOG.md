As a class, landed on bitshifting. HOwever, I can't think of a way to convert the entire sequence into binary. |

If there is a search hit I increment the loop variable by the length of the STR. In addition, I use char at instead of substring because it is slightly faster |

My new approach start by creating a number that represents the STR then for every letter bitshift by two then compare the two letters. |

I start by initializing the first of length of STR. I use a reigning champ to keep track of the max number of repeats |

I diagnosed a problem, where the temporary value of the current subsection within a string wasn't resetting. A big error I found was that I was encoding the STR wrong. |
| October 14 | 0815-0845 | I made use of the debugger where I found a setting that lets you view any data in binary. I saw that I was left shifting an extra time. I fixed this by swapping the location of the bitwise or and the left shift. This revealed another problem which was in the main loop. I need to find a way to erase the last letter of the current substring I am on. My current approach says to left shift it enough to erase it then right shift it back one less time. But that doesn't work |

I start by using horner's method twice to find the value of the str and the first sequence. Then, I created a method to apply the rabin karp algorithm. I subtract by the last letter bitshifted 2 * (length -1). I use a reigning champ to keep track of the maxCount. |

Instead of substracting I just bit shift the last letter off a cliff and then I shift it back. This allows me for one less input to the rabin karp method. I added comments and made the number 4 a constant for RADIX. |

In addition, I was not checking for consecutive Short Tandem repeats so I imnplemented horners method inside my main loop. I also switch horners method to bitshifting instead of multiplying by a radix. |

I also added debug features that prints out every hash. |

This makes me able to run the inner forloop for the complete length before incrementing i. I am certain bug occurs in that if statement but not sure what. |

I changed in my horners method inside the main loop to i - j as j goes down and it worked. Every case except for testLargest works. Test largest is off by 1. |
