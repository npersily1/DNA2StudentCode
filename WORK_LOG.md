| October 10 | 1130-1200 |                                                                                                                                Discussed possible solutions in class. As a class, landed on bitshifting. HOwever, I can't think of a way to convert the entire sequence into binary. |
| October 13 | 0230-0300 | Made simple backbone code that iterates through the entire string and it has a nested loop for the length of the STR. If there is a search hit I increment the loop variable by the length of the STR. In addition, I use char at instead of substring because it is slightly faster |
| October 14 | 0900-0930 |                       I scrapped all my old code because Landon finally explained bitwise operations in a way that made a lot of sense to me. My new approach start by creating a number that represents the STR then for every letter bitshift by two then compare the two letters. |

I start by initializing the first of length of STR. I use a reigning champ to keep track of the max number of repeats |
